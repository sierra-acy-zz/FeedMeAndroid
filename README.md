# FeedMeAndroid

FeedMe is an app for the truly indecisive. FeedMe chooses a restaurant for the user to eat at with no user input. Users also have the option to set filters. Filters range from general filters for Meal, Dessert, or Drinks to advanced filters for the style of food (e.g., Fast Food, Mexican), type of experience (e.g., sit down, fast food, take-out), and price range ($-$$$$).

### Adding Restauants to a List
To add a restaurant to the restaurant list, click on the Settings icon in the top right corner. Next, click the "Add Restaurant" button. Fill in the form fields and save. The restaurant will appear at the bottom of the list on the Edit Restaurant List page. Click "Save" at the bottom of this page to save the updated list. If you do not click save, any changes to the list will be discarded.

### Editing and Deleting Restaurants
To edit an existing restaurant, click on the Settings icon in the top right corner. Next, click on the quill-and-ink icon next to the restaurant that needs to be changed. This will open up the Edit Restaurant page with the current values filled in. Make the desired changes and save. The restaurant will appear at the bottom of the list on the Edit Restaurant List page.

To delete an existing restaurant, click the trash can icon next to the restaurant. Click "Yes" in the confirmation popup message. The restaurant will be removed from the list.

### General Filters
General filters are available on the main screen of the application. They include checkboxes for "Meal," "Dessert," and "Drinks." Use these filters to narrow the restaurants available to be chosen from to fit the corresponding restrictions. For example, if the user wants a restaurant for a meal and dessert, they can check the filters "Meal", "Dessert" and it will return a restaurant that falls under both categories.

### Advanced Filters
Advanced filters are available by clicking the "Advanced Filters" button on the main screen. These filters include the style of food (e.g., Fast Food, Mexican), type of experience (e.g., sit down, fast food, take-out), and price range ($-$$$$). Use these filters to narrow down the restaurants available to be chosen from to fit the corresponding restrictions. For example, if a user wants a sit-down restaurant that has Mexican food inthe $$ price range, the application will return a restaurant that falls under all of these categories, if available. To apply filters, click "Apply". The user will be returned to the main screen.

### Getting a Result
To choose a restaurant, click the big "FEED ME" button on the main screen after choosing desired filters. The result will be displayed underneath the button.

### Starting Over
To clear all filters and restart, click the "Start Over" button at the bottom of the results page. The user will be taken back to the main screen with no filters chosen.
